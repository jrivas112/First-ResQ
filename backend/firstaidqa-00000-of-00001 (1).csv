"Do Abrasions cause scars?
","Abrasions are superficial wounds that generally do not penetrate deep enough to leave scars. However, the extent of skin damage caused by an abrasion and the location of the abrasion can affect whether or not a scar forms. For example, if an abrasion is deep enough to cause damage to deeper layers of the skin, it may leave a scar. In addition, if an abrasion is located in an area of the body where the skin is under tension, such as the joints or face, it may be more likely to form a scar. Similarly, if an abrasion becomes infected or is not properly treated, it may increase the risk of scarring. To help prevent scarring from an abrasion, it's important to keep the wound clean and covered, avoid picking at scabs that form, and use over-the-counter scar reduction products if recommended by your healthcare provider. If you're concerned about scarring or have a wound that is not healing properly, it's best to seek medical attention from a healthcare professional.

Move the victim to a warm environment. Remove wet clothing. Cover the victim. Place warm compresses on the armpits and groin. When there are no signs of life perform CPR. For babies, tilt their head back and lift their chin to open their airway. In case of no heartbeat, perform CRP. For infants use two fingers, place them on the baby's breastbone just below the nipple line, and press down about 1 1/2 inches. Perform 30 compressions at a rate of 100-120 compressions per minute. After the 30 compressions, give two gentle breaths into the baby's mouth and nose, making sure to create a seal over both the mouth and nose. Continue performing cycles of 30 compressions and 2 breaths until emergency medical services arrive. For children and adults place the heel of one hand on the center of the person's chest, between the nipples, and place your other hand on top. Press down hard and fast, aiming for a depth of about 2 inches (5 centimeters). Push hard and fast at a rate of about 100 to 120 compressions per minute. Tilt the person's head back, pinch their nose shut, and give two rescue breaths. Each breath should be enough to make the person's chest rise. Repeat the cycle of 30 chest compressions and two rescue breaths until the person starts breathing again or emergency medical services arrive. If the person is breathing normally, remove the victim's clothes and check for burns at the entrance and exit of the electric current and for injuries from possible ejection after the electric current enters the human body. Protect from hypothermia. Anyone who has been electrocuted or struck by lightning should seek medical attention. Rewarm the victim.

"How to cure Fainting?
","Fainting, also known as syncope, is a temporary loss of consciousness caused by a lack of blood flow to the brain. If you witness someone fainting, it's important to act quickly and catch the person and ease them to the ground to prevent further injury. Then, check the airways to confirm nothing is blocking breathing. Raise their legs above the level of their heart to increase blood flow to the brain. Loosen any tight clothing around their neck, chest or waist to allow for better breathing. If the person is conscious, have them slowly drink water or a non-alcoholic beverage to help prevent dehydration. Stay with the person until they are fully recovered, and call for emergency medical help if the person doesn't regain consciousness within a minute or two or if they are injured during the fall. Meanwhile, you can perform CPR. If you feel like you're going to pass out, lie down and place your legs higher or sit with your head between your legs.

","A stroke is defined as damage to the brain of vascular etiology, a stroke that originated either from an interruption of the blood supply to the affected area (ischemic), or from bleeding as a consequence of the rupture of a vessel (hemorrhagic).

There are cases where the damage is great and we may lose consciousness until stopping. It's important to note the time when symptoms first started, as this can help medical professionals determine the best treatment options. Help the person lie down and stay calm while waiting for emergency services to arrive. If the person stops breathing or their heart stops beating, perform CPR until emergency services arrive. Do not give the person any medications unless instructed to do so by a medical professional. If the person is conscious, support their head and neck to prevent any movement. If the person is wearing tight clothing, such as a tie or scarf, loosen it to ensure they can breathe comfortably.

"When should you seek emergency medical assistance if you have food poisoning?","You should seek emergency medical assistance if you have severe symptoms (such as severe abdominal pain or watery diarrhea that turns very bloody within 24 hours), belong to a high-risk group, or suspect botulism poisoning."
"What are the symptoms of botulism poisoning?","Symptoms of botulism usually begin 12 to 36 hours after eating the contaminated food and may include headache, blurred vision, muscle weakness and eventual paralysis. Some people also have nausea and vomiting, constipation, urinary retention, difficulty breathing, and a dry mouth. These symptoms require immediate medical attention."
"What is CPR?","Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a lifesaving technique used in emergencies, such as a heart attack or near drowning, in which someone's breathing or heartbeat has stopped."
"What is the American Heart Association's recommendation for starting CPR?","The American Heart Association recommends starting CPR with hard and fast chest compressions. This hands-only CPR recommendation applies to both untrained bystanders and first responders."
"What should you do if you're afraid or unsure how to perform CPR correctly?","If you're afraid to do CPR or unsure how to perform CPR correctly, know that it's always better to try than to do nothing at all. The difference between doing something and doing nothing could be someone's life."
"What should you do if you're untrained in CPR or worried about giving rescue breaths?","If you're not trained in CPR or worried about giving rescue breaths, then provide hands-only CPR. That means uninterrupted chest compressions of 100 to 120 a minute until paramedics arrive. You don't need to try rescue breathing."
"What should you do if you're well-trained and confident in your ability to perform CPR?","If you're well-trained and confident in your ability, check to see if there is a pulse and breathing. If there is no pulse or breathing within 10 seconds, begin chest compressions. Start CPR with 30 chest compressions before giving two rescue breaths."
"What should you do if you've previously received CPR training but you're not confident in your abilities?","If you've previously received CPR training but you're not confident in your abilities, then just do chest compressions at a rate of 100 to 120 a minute."
"Does the above advice apply to newborns?","No, the above advice applies to situations in which adults, children and infants need CPR, but not newborns (infants up to 4 weeks old)."
"What is the purpose of CPR?","CPR can keep oxygen-rich blood flowing to the brain and other organs until emergency medical treatment can restore a typical heart rhythm. When the heart stops, the body no longer gets oxygen-rich blood. The lack of oxygen-rich blood can cause brain damage in only a few minutes."
"What should you do if you are untrained and need to perform CPR?","If you are untrained and have immediate access to a phone, call 911 or your local emergency number before beginning CPR. The dispatcher can instruct you in the proper procedures until help arrives. To learn CPR properly, take an accredited first-aid training course, including CPR and how to use an automated external defibrillator (AED)."
"What should you check before starting CPR?","Before starting CPR, you should check if the environment is safe for the person and if the person is conscious or unconscious. If the person appears unconscious, tap or shake his or her shoulder and ask loudly, 'Are you OK?'"
"What should you do if the person is unconscious and doesn't respond?","If the person is unconscious and doesn't respond, and you're with another person who can help, have one person call 911 or the local emergency number and get the automated external defibrillator (AED), if one is available. Have the other person begin CPR. If you are alone and have immediate access to a telephone, call 911 or your local emergency number before beginning CPR. Get the AED if one is available."
"What is the order of steps to perform CPR?","The American Heart Association uses the letters C-A-B to help people remember the order to perform the steps of CPR. C stands for compressions, A stands for airway, and B stands for breathing."
"What is the most important step in CPR?","Compressions are the most important step in CPR. Compressions mean you'll use your hands to push down hard and fast in a specific way on the person's chest to restore blood flow."
"What are the steps for performing CPR compressions?","To perform CPR compressions, put the person on his or her back on a firm surface, kneel next to the person's neck and shoulders, place the lower palm (heel) of your hand over the center of the person's chest between the nipples, place your other hand on top of the first hand, keep your elbows straight and position your shoulders directly above your hands, push straight down on (compress) the chest at least 2 inches (5 centimeters) but no more than 2.4 inches (6 centimeters), use your entire body weight (not just your arms) when doing compressions, push hard at a rate of 100 to 120 compressions a minute, and allow the chest to spring back (recoil) after each push. If you haven't been trained in CPR, continue chest compressions until there are signs of movement or until emergency medical personnel take over. If you have been trained in CPR, go on to opening the airway and rescue breathing."
"What should you do after performing 30 chest compressions during CPR?","If you're trained in CPR and you've performed 30 chest compressions, open the person's airway using the head-tilt, chin-lift maneuver."
"How do you open the airway during CPR?","Put your palm on the person's forehead and gently tilt the head back. Then with the other hand, gently lift the chin forward to open the airway."
"What is rescue breathing in CPR?","Rescue breathing can be mouth-to-mouth breathing or mouth-to-nose breathing if the mouth is seriously injured or can't be opened. Current recommendations suggest performing rescue breathing using a bag-mask device with a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter."
"How do you perform mouth-to-mouth rescue breathing during CPR?","After opening the airway (using the head-tilt, chin-lift maneuver), pinch the nostrils shut for mouth-to-mouth breathing and cover the person's mouth with yours, making a seal. Prepare to give two rescue breaths. Give the first rescue breath — lasting one second — and watch to see if the chest rises. If the chest rises, give a second breath. If the chest doesn't rise, repeat the head-tilt, chin-lift maneuver and then give a second breath. Thirty chest compressions followed by two rescue breaths is considered one cycle. Be careful not to provide too many breaths or to breathe with too much force."
"What should you do after giving rescue breaths during CPR?","Resume chest compressions to restore blood flow."
"What should you do as soon as an automated external defibrillator (AED) is available during CPR?","Apply it and follow the prompts. Give one shock, then resume chest compressions for two more minutes before giving a second shock."
"What should you do if you're not trained to use an AED during CPR?","A 911 operator or another emergency medical operator may be able to give you instructions."
"When should you stop performing CPR?","Continue CPR until there are signs of movement or emergency medical personnel take over."
"What should you do first if you are alone and didn't see the child collapse when performing CPR on a child?","Start chest compressions for about two minutes, then quickly call 911 or your local emergency number and get the AED if one is available."
"What should you do first if you are alone and did see the child collapse when performing CPR on a child?","Call 911 or your local emergency number first, then get the AED if available, and start CPR. If another person is with you, have that person call for help and get the AED while you start CPR."
"What should you do to perform chest compressions when giving CPR to a child?","Place the child on his or her back on a firm surface. Kneel next to the child's neck and shoulders. Place two hands (or only one hand if the child is very small) on the lower half of the child's breastbone (sternum). Using the heel of one or both hands, press straight down on (compress) the chest about 2 inches (approximately 5 centimeters) but not greater than 2.4 inches (approximately 6 centimeters). Push hard and fast — 100 to 120 compressions a minute."
"What should you do to open the airway when performing CPR on a child?","If you're trained in CPR and you've performed 30 chest compressions, open the child's airway using the head-tilt, chin-lift maneuver. Place your palm on the child's forehead and gently tilt his or her head back. With the other hand, gently lift the chin forward to open the airway."
"What should you do if you haven't been trained in CPR when giving CPR to a child?","Continue chest compressions until the child moves or until emergency medical personnel take over."
"When should you start rescue breathing when giving CPR to a child?","If you have been trained in CPR, open the airway and start rescue breathing after performing chest compressions."
"What are the steps for mouth-to-mouth breathing for a child during CPR?","After using the head-tilt, chin-lift maneuver to open the airway, pinch the child's nostrils shut. Cover the child's mouth with yours, making a seal. Breathe into the child's mouth for one second and watch to see if the chest rises. If it rises, give a second breath. If the chest doesn't rise, repeat the head-tilt, chin-lift maneuver first, and then give the second breath. Be careful not to provide too many breaths or to breathe with too much force. After the two breaths, immediately begin the next cycle of compressions and breaths. Note: If there are two people available to do CPR on the child, change rescuers every two minutes — or sooner if the rescuer is fatigued — and give one to two breaths every 15 compressions."
"What should you do as soon as an AED becomes available during CPR for a child?","As soon as an AED is available, apply it and follow the prompts. Use pediatric pads for children older than 4 weeks old and up to age 8. If pediatric pads aren't available, use adult pads. Give one shock, then restart CPR — starting with chest compressions — for two more minutes before giving a second shock. If you're not trained to use an AED, a 911 operator or another emergency medical operator may be able to give you directions."
"How should you perform CPR on a baby 4 weeks old or older?","First, evaluate the situation. Touch the baby and watch for a response, such as movement. Don't shake the baby. If there's no response, call 911 or your local emergency number, then immediately start CPR. Follow the compressions, airway and breathing (C-A-B) procedure for a baby under age 1 (except newborns, which include babies up to 4 weeks old)."
"What is the compressions procedure for a baby under age 1 during CPR?","Place the baby on his or her back on a firm, flat surface, such as a table or floor. Imagine a horizontal line drawn between the baby's nipples. Place two fingers of one hand just below this line, in the center of the chest. Gently compress the chest about 1.5 inches (about 4 centimeters). Count aloud as you push in a fairly rapid rhythm. You should push at a rate of 100 to 120 compressions a minute, just as you would when giving an adult CPR."
"How do you open the airway during CPR for a baby?","After 30 compressions, gently tip the head back by lifting the chin with one hand and pushing down on the forehead with the other hand."
"What is the process for breathing during CPR for a baby?","Cover the baby's mouth and nose with your mouth. Prepare to give two rescue breaths. Use the strength of your cheeks to deliver gentle puffs of air (instead of deep breaths from your lungs) to slowly breathe into the baby's mouth one time, taking one second for the breath. Watch to see if the baby's chest rises. If it does, give a second rescue breath. If the chest does not rise, repeat the head-tilt, chin-lift maneuver and then give the second breath. If the baby's chest still doesn't rise, continue chest compressions. Give two breaths after every 30 chest compressions. If two people are performing CPR, give one to two breaths after every 15 chest compressions. Continue CPR until you see signs of life or until medical personnel arrive."
"What should you do if a venomous snake bites you?","Call 911 or your local emergency number immediately, especially if the bitten area changes color, begins to swell, or is painful. Move beyond the snake's striking distance, remain still and calm to help slow the spread of venom, remove jewelry and tight clothing before you start to swell, position yourself, if possible, so that the bite is at or below the level of your heart, clean the wound with soap and water, and cover it with a clean, dry dressing."
"What should you not do if a venomous snake bites you?","Don't use a tourniquet or apply ice, don't cut the wound or attempt to remove the venom, don't drink caffeine or alcohol, which could speed your body's absorption of venom, and don't try to capture the snake."
"What are the symptoms of a nonvenomous snake bite?","Typical symptoms of the bite from a nonvenomous snake are pain and scratches at the site."
"What are the symptoms of a venomous snake bite?","After a bite from a venomous snake, there is severe burning pain at the site within 15 to 30 minutes. This can progress to swelling and bruising at the wound and all the way up the arm or leg. Other signs and symptoms include nausea, labored breathing, a general sense of weakness, and an odd taste in the mouth. Some snakes, such as coral snakes, have toxins that cause neurological symptoms, such as skin tingling, difficulty speaking, and weakness."
"What should you do if you are bitten by a snake?","If a venomous snake bites you, call 911 or your local emergency number immediately. Move beyond the snake's striking distance, remain still and calm to help slow the spread of venom, remove jewelry and tight clothing before you start to swell, position yourself, if possible, so that the bite is at or below the level of your heart, clean the wound with soap and water, and cover it with a clean, dry dressing. Don't use a tourniquet or apply ice, don't cut the wound or attempt to remove the venom, don't drink caffeine or alcohol, which could speed your body's absorption of venom, and don't try to capture the snake. Try to remember the snake's color and shape so that you can describe it, which will help in your treatment. If possible, take a picture of the snake from a safe distance to help with identification."
"Which snakes are venomous in North America?","Most venomous snakes in North America have eyes like slits and are known as pit vipers. Their heads are triangular and they have fangs. One exception is the coral snake, which has a rounded head and round pupils."
"What are the signs and symptoms of sunburn?","The signs and symptoms of sunburn include painful, inflamed, and hot to the touch skin. Blisters might also develop. Additionally, headache, fever, or nausea can be experienced."
"When should I seek immediate medical care for a sunburn?","You should seek immediate medical care for sunburn if you experience a fever over 103 degrees Fahrenheit (39.4 degrees Celsius) with vomiting, confusion, an infection in the sunburned area, or dehydration."
"What are some first aid measures for sunburn?","Some first aid measures for sunburn include taking a pain reliever such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen, cooling the skin with cool tap water or a cool bath, applying a moisturizer or lotion such as aloe vera or calamine lotion, drinking extra water to prevent dehydration, leaving blisters alone, protecting yourself from further sun exposure, applying nonprescription 1% hydrocortisone cream to the affected area, and treating sunburned eyes by covering them with a clean towel dampened with cool tap water."
"When should I seek medical care for sunburn?","You should seek medical care for sunburn if you have large blisters or blisters that form on the face, hands, or genitals, worsening pain, headache, confusion, nausea, fever, chills, eye pain or vision changes, or signs of infection such as blisters with swelling, pus, or streaks."
"What are the symptoms of a heart attack?","Someone having a heart attack may have chest pain, pressure or tightness, or a squeezing or aching sensation in the center of the chest. They may also experience pain or discomfort that spreads to the shoulder, arm, back, neck, jaw, teeth, or occasionally upper abdomen. Other symptoms can include nausea, indigestion, heartburn or abdominal pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, dizziness, fainting, and sweating."
"How long does chest pain typically last during a heart attack?","A heart attack generally causes chest pain for more than 15 minutes. Some people have mild chest pain, while others have more-severe pain. The discomfort is commonly described as a pressure or chest heaviness, although some people have no chest pain or pressure at all."
"What should you do if you think you or someone else is having a heart attack?","Call 911 or your local emergency number immediately. Don't ignore the symptoms of a heart attack. If you can't get an ambulance or emergency vehicle to come to you, have a neighbor or a friend drive you to the nearest hospital. Drive yourself only if you have no other option. Chew and swallow an aspirin while waiting for emergency help, and take nitroglycerin if prescribed by a doctor."
"What should you do if the person having a heart attack is unconscious?","If the person is unconscious, call for emergency medical help and begin CPR to keep blood flowing. Push hard and fast on the center of the person's chest in a fairly rapid rhythm — about 100 to 120 compressions a minute. If an automated external defibrillator (AED) is immediately available and the person is unconscious, follow the device instructions for using it."
"What should you do while waiting for emergency help to arrive during a heart attack?","Chew and swallow an aspirin while waiting for emergency help. Aspirin helps keep your blood from clotting. When taken during a heart attack, it could reduce heart damage. Don't take aspirin if you are allergic to it or have been told by your health care provider never to take aspirin. If you think you're having a heart attack and your health care provider has previously prescribed nitroglycerin for you, take it as directed while waiting for emergency medical help."
"What is a stroke?","A stroke happens when there's bleeding into the brain or when blood flow to the brain is blocked. When brain cells are deprived of essential nutrients, they start dying within minutes."
"What should you do in the event of a possible stroke?","Use F.A.S.T. to help remember warning signs. Face: Does the face droop on one side when the person tries to smile? Arms: Is one arm lower when the person tries to raise both arms? Speech: Can the person repeat a simple sentence? Is speech slurred or hard to understand? Time: During a stroke every minute counts. If you see any of these signs, call 911 or your local emergency number right away."
"What are other signs and symptoms of a stroke?","Other signs and symptoms of a stroke, which come on suddenly, include: Weakness or numbness on one side of the body, including the face, arm or leg. Dimness, blurring or loss of vision, particularly in one eye. Or sudden double vision. Sudden, severe headache with no clear cause. Unexplained dizziness, unsteadiness or a sudden fall. Especially if dizziness is accompanied by any of the other signs or symptoms."
"What is the importance of seeking immediate medical help in the event of a stroke?","A stroke is a true emergency. The sooner treatment is given, the more likely it is that damage can be minimized. Every moment counts."
"What are some risk factors for having a stroke?","Risk factors for having a stroke include having high blood pressure, smoking, having diabetes and having heart disease. Your risk of stroke increases as you age."
"What should I do if the broken bone is the result of major trauma or injury?","If the broken bone is the result of major trauma or injury, call 911 or your local emergency number."
"When should I call for emergency help?","Call for emergency help if the person is unresponsive, isn't breathing or isn't moving. Begin CPR if there's no breathing or heartbeat. Also, call for emergency help if there is heavy bleeding, even gentle pressure or movement causes pain, the limb or joint appears deformed, the bone has pierced the skin, the extremity of the injured arm or leg is numb or bluish at the tip, or you suspect a bone is broken in the neck, head, or back."
"Should I move the person if they have a broken bone?","Don't move the person except if necessary to avoid further injury."
"What actions should I take immediately while waiting for medical help?","Stop any bleeding, immobilize the injured area, apply ice packs to limit swelling and help relieve pain, and treat for shock. Don't try to realign the bone or push a bone that's sticking out back in. If you've been trained in how to splint and professional help isn't readily available, apply a splint to the area above and below the fracture sites. Padding the splints can help reduce discomfort. Don't apply ice directly to the skin. Wrap the ice in a towel, piece of cloth, or some other material. If the person feels faint or is breathing in short, rapid breaths, lay the person down with the head slightly lower than the trunk and, if possible, elevate the legs."
"What is a sprain?","A sprain is an injury to a ligament caused by tearing of the fibers of the ligament."
"What are the most common types of sprains?","Ankle sprains are the most common type of sprain, but wrist, knee and thumb sprains are also common."
"What is the initial treatment for a minor sprain?","For most minor sprains, you can start initial injury treatment yourself. Follow the instructions for R.I.C.E., which stands for rest, ice, compress, and elevate."
"What does R.I.C.E. stand for?","R.I.C.E. stands for rest, ice, compress, and elevate. Rest the injured limb, ice the area, compress the area with an elastic wrap or bandage, and elevate the injured limb above your heart whenever possible to help prevent or limit swelling."
"How long does it take for a sprain to recover?","Sprains can take days to months to recover. As the pain and swelling improve, gently begin using the injured area. You should feel a gradual, progressive improvement."
"What should you do to restore strength and stability to the injured limb?","It is essential to restore strength and stability to the injured limb prior to a return to sports or fitness activities. A physical therapist or other sports medicine provider can provide you with the appropriate strength and stability exercises to optimize healing and minimize the risk of repeat injury."
"When should you see a doctor for a sprain?","See your doctor if your sprain isn't improving after two or three days. Get emergency medical assistance if you're unable to bear weight on the injured leg, the joint feels unstable or numb, or you can't use the joint. This may mean the ligament was completely torn. Also seek medical attention if you develop redness or red streaks that spread out from the injured area, you have pain directly over the bones of an injured joint, you have re-injured an area that has been injured a number of times in the past, or you have a severe sprain."
"What is a corneal abrasion?","A corneal abrasion is a superficial scratch on the clear, protective 'window' at the front of the eye (cornea)."
"What are the symptoms of corneal abrasion?","The symptoms of corneal abrasion include pain, blurry vision, a gritty feeling in the eye, tearing, redness, sensitivity to light (photophobia), and headache."
"What should you do in case of a corneal abrasion?","In case of a corneal abrasion, seek prompt medical attention. Meanwhile, rinse your eye with clean water or a saline solution, blink several times, and pull the upper eyelid over the lower eyelid. Avoid making the injury worse by not trying to remove an embedded object, not rubbing your eye after an injury, not touching your eye with cotton swabs or other instruments, and not wearing contact lenses while your eye is healing."
"How long does it take for most corneal abrasions to heal?","Most corneal abrasions heal in a few days but should be treated with antibiotic drops or ointment to reduce the risk of infection."
"What is hypothermia?","Hypothermia occurs when your body loses heat faster than it can produce heat and your body temperature falls below 95 F (35 C)."
"What are the causes of hypothermia?","Hypothermia is often caused by exposure to cold weather or immersion in a cold body of water. It can also be caused by ongoing exposure to indoor temperatures below 50 F (10 C). You could be at increased risk if you're also exhausted or dehydrated."
"What are the signs and symptoms of hypothermia?","Signs and symptoms of hypothermia usually develop slowly and may include shivering, though this may stop as body temperature drops, slurred speech or mumbling, slow, shallow breathing, weak pulse, clumsiness or lack of coordination, drowsiness or very low energy, confusion or memory loss, loss of consciousness, and bright red, cold skin (in infants)."
"What should I do if I suspect someone has hypothermia?","If you suspect someone has hypothermia, call 911 or your local emergency number. Then immediately take these steps: gently move the person out of the cold, remove wet clothing, offer warm, dry coats or blankets, gradually warm the person with warm, dry compresses or an electric blanket, offer warm, sweet, nonalcoholic drinks, and begin CPR if the person shows no signs of life."
"What should I avoid doing when treating someone with hypothermia?","When treating someone with hypothermia, you should avoid rewarming the person too quickly, such as with a heating lamp or hot bath. Don't attempt to warm the arms and legs, as heating or massaging the limbs of someone in this condition can stress the heart and lungs. Finally, don't give the person alcohol or cigarettes, as alcohol hinders the rewarming process and tobacco products interfere with circulation that is needed for rewarming."
"How should I handle a tooth that has been knocked out?","Handle the tooth by the top or crown only, and don't touch the roots."
"What should I do if my tooth has dirt or foreign material on it?","Gently rinse the tooth briefly in a bowl of lukewarm tap water for no more than 10 seconds to remove debris. Don't hold it under running water, as this could kill the cells on the root surface that help reattach the tooth."
"What should I do if I can't put the tooth back in the socket?","If you can't put the tooth back in the socket, immediately place it between your cheek and gum, or in cold milk or your own saliva. Alternatively, use an over-the-counter product that preserves a knocked-out tooth if you have quick access to it."
"Should I try to reimplant the tooth myself?","Try to put the tooth back in the socket if possible. If it doesn't go all the way into place, bite down slowly and gently on gauze or a moistened paper towel to help keep it in place. Hold the tooth in place until you see your dentist. If you can't reimplant the tooth yourself, get emergency dental care."
"What should I do if I can't get to a dentist right away?","If your dentist's office isn't open, go to the emergency room."
"Are baby teeth implanted if they're knocked out?","No, baby teeth (primary teeth) are not implanted if they're knocked out."
"How long do I have to reimplant the tooth for it to have a good chance of success?","Reimplantation should occur within two hours after the tooth is knocked out. Sooner is better, as the likelihood of success becomes poor after this time frame."
"What are some common causes of chest pain?","Causes of chest pain can vary from minor problems, such as heartburn or emotional stress, to serious medical emergencies, such as a heart attack or blood clot in the lungs (pulmonary embolism)."
"What are the symptoms of a heart attack?","Someone having a heart attack may have chest pain, pressure or tightness, or a squeezing or aching sensation in the center of the chest, pain or discomfort that spreads to the shoulder, arm, back, neck, jaw, teeth or occasionally upper abdomen, nausea, indigestion, heartburn or abdominal pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, dizziness, fainting, and sweating."
"What should I do if I or someone else may be having a heart attack?","Call 911 or emergency medical assistance, chew aspirin if not allergic or otherwise instructed not to do so, take nitroglycerin if prescribed, begin CPR if necessary, and follow instructions for using an AED if available."
"What is angina?","Angina is chest pain or discomfort caused by reduced blood flow to your heart muscle."
"What is the difference between stable and unstable angina?","Stable angina is chest pain that usually occurs with activity and is relatively predictable. The chest pain tends to follow a pattern. Unstable angina is chest pain that is sudden or new or changes from the typical pattern, and may be a sign of a future heart attack."
"What should I do if my angina gets worse or changes?","Seek emergency medical help immediately."
"What is a pulmonary embolism?","A pulmonary embolism is a blood clot in the lung that interrupts blood flow, making it more difficult for your lungs to provide oxygen to the rest of your body. Symptoms may include sudden, sharp chest pain often with shortness of breath, cough that may produce blood-streaked spit, rapid heartbeat with shortness of breath, fainting, severe anxiety, unexplained sweating, and swelling of one leg only caused by a blood clot in the leg."
"What is an aortic dissection?","An aortic dissection is a tear in the inner layer of the aorta, the large blood vessel branching off the heart. Symptoms may include sudden severe chest or upper back pain, often described as a tearing, ripping or shearing sensation, that radiates to the neck or down the back, loss of consciousness (fainting), shortness of breath, sudden difficulty speaking, loss of vision, weakness or paralysis of one side of your body, such as having a stroke, heavy sweating, and weak pulse in one arm compared with the other."
"What are the signs and symptoms of pneumonia with pleurisy?","Frequent signs and symptoms of pneumonia are chest pain accompanied by chills, fever and a cough that may produce bloody or foul-smelling sputum. Pleurisy is inflammation of the membranes that surround the lung (pleura). It can cause chest pain when taking a breath or coughing. Unlike a true heart attack, pleurisy pain is usually relieved temporarily by holding your breath or putting pressure on the painful area of your chest."
"What is pericarditis?","Pericarditis is swelling and irritation of the thin, saclike tissue surrounding your heart (pericardium). Pericarditis can cause sharp chest pain that gets worse when you cough, lie down, or take a deep breath. Pericarditis is usually mild and goes away without treatment. If it's severe, you may need medication or, rarely, surgery. It may be difficult to tell the difference between sudden (acute) pericarditis and pain due to a heart attack. If you have sudden, unexplained chest pain, seek emergency medical help."
"What is pulmonary embolism and what are its symptoms?","Pulmonary embolism is a blood clot in the lung, and its symptoms may include sudden, sharp chest pain often with shortness of breath, sudden unexplained shortness of breath, cough that may produce blood-streaked spit, rapid heartbeat with shortness of breath, fainting, severe anxiety, unexplained sweating, and swelling of one leg only, caused by a blood clot in the leg."
"What is aortic dissection and what are its symptoms?","Aortic dissection is a tear in the inner layer of the aorta, and its symptoms may include sudden severe chest or upper back pain, often described as a tearing, ripping or shearing sensation, that radiates to the neck or down the back, loss of consciousness (fainting), shortness of breath, sudden difficulty speaking, loss of vision, weakness or paralysis of one side of your body, such as having a stroke, heavy sweating, and weak pulse in one arm compared with the other."
"What is pneumonia with pleurisy and what are its symptoms?","Pneumonia with pleurisy can cause chest pain when taking a breath or coughing and is accompanied by chills, fever, and a cough that may produce bloody or foul-smelling sputum."
"What is pericarditis and what are its symptoms?","Pericarditis is swelling and irritation of the thin, saclike tissue surrounding your heart, and its symptoms include sharp chest pain that gets worse when you cough, lie down, or take a deep breath."
"What is chest wall pain, and what can cause it?","Chest wall pain is a type of muscle pain, and bruised chest muscles, excessive coughing, straining, or minor injury can cause harmless chest pain. One type of chest wall pain is costochondritis, which causes pain and tenderness in and around the cartilage that connects your ribs to your breastbone."
"When should I see a doctor for chest pain?","If your chest pain is new, changing or otherwise unexplained, seek help from a health care provider. If you think you're having a heart attack, call 911 or your local emergency number. Don't try to diagnose the chest pain yourself or ignore it. Your treatment will depend on the specific cause of the pain."
"Why can human bites be dangerous?","Human bites can be as dangerous as or even more dangerous than animal bites because of the types of bacteria and viruses contained in the human mouth."
"What is considered a human bite?","If someone cuts his or her knuckles on another person's teeth, as might happen in a fight, this is also considered a human bite. And a cut on the knuckles from your own teeth, such as from a fall, is considered a human bite."
"How should you take care of a human bite that breaks the skin?","Stop the bleeding by applying pressure with a clean, dry cloth. Wash the wound thoroughly with soap and water. Apply a clean bandage. Cover the affected area with a nonstick bandage. Seek emergency medical care."

"What should you do if someone else faints?","Position the person on the back. If there are no injuries and the person is breathing, raise the person's legs above heart level if possible. Prop up the person's legs about 12 inches (30 centimeters). Loosen belts, collars or other tight clothing. To reduce the chance of fainting again, don't get the person up too fast. If the person doesn't regain consciousness within one minute, call 911 or your local emergency number."
"What should you do if the person who fainted is not breathing?","Check for breathing. Check for a pulse and to see if the person is breathing. If the person is not breathing, begin CPR. Call 911 or your local emergency number. Continue CPR until help arrives or the person begins to breathe."
"What should you do if the person who fainted was injured in a fall?","Treat bumps, bruises or cuts appropriately. Control bleeding with direct pressure."
"When should you talk to your health care provider if you faint?","Talk to your health care provider if you faint more than once."

"What first aid steps should you take while waiting for emergency medical help to arrive for someone with head trauma?","Keep the person still. The injured person should lie down with the head and shoulders slightly elevated. Don't move the person unless necessary. Avoid moving the person's neck. If the person is wearing a helmet, don't remove it. Stop any bleeding. Apply firm pressure to the wound with sterile gauze or a clean cloth. But don't apply direct pressure to the wound if you suspect a skull fracture. Watch for changes in breathing and alertness. If the person shows no signs of circulation — no breathing, coughing or movement — begin CPR."
"What are the concussion symptoms that require evaluation by a medical professional?","Nausea, unsteadiness, headaches, or difficulty concentrating."
"What is heat exhaustion?","Heat exhaustion is a heat-related syndrome that occurs when the body loses too much water or salt, usually from excessive sweating or dehydration. It can begin suddenly or happen over time, usually after working, exercising, or playing in the heat."

"What should you do if you suspect someone has heat exhaustion?","If you suspect someone has heat exhaustion, move the person out of the heat and into a shady or air-conditioned place, lay the person down and elevate the legs and feet slightly, remove tight or heavy clothing, have the person sip chilled water, a decaffeinated sports drink containing electrolytes or other nonalcoholic beverage without caffeine, cool the person by spraying or sponging with cool water and fanning, and monitor the person carefully. Contact a health care provider if signs or symptoms worsen or if the person doesn't improve after taking first-aid measures."
"When should you call 911 or your local emergency number?","You should call 911 or your local emergency number if the person's condition gets worse, especially if he or she experiences fainting, agitation, confusion, seizures, inability to drink, or a core body temperature measured by rectal thermometer of 104 F (40 C) (heatstroke)."
"What is choking?","Choking happens when an object lodges in the throat or windpipe blocking the flow of air."
"What are the signs of choking?","Signs of choking include one or both hands clutched to the throat, a look of panic, shock or confusion, inability to talk, strained or noisy breathing, squeaky sounds when trying to breathe, cough, which may either be weak or forceful, skin, lips and nails that change color turning blue or gray and loss of consciousness."
"What should you do if a choking person can cough forcefully?","If a choking person can cough forcefully, let the person keep coughing. Coughing might naturally remove the stuck object."
"What should you do if a person can't cough, talk, cry or laugh forcefully?","If a person can't cough, talk, cry or laugh forcefully, give first aid to the person."
"What are the steps for first aid for a choking person?","The American Red Cross recommends the following steps: 1) Give five back blows. 2) Give five abdominal thrusts. 3) Alternate between five blows and five thrusts until the blockage is dislodged."
"How do you perform abdominal thrusts on someone else?","To give abdominal thrusts to someone else, stand behind the person. For a child, kneel down behind. Place one foot slightly in front of the other for balance. Wrap your arms around the waist. Tip the person forward slightly. Make a fist with one hand. Put it just above the person's navel. Grasp the fist with the other hand. Press into the stomach, also called the abdomen, with a quick, upward thrust — as if trying to lift the person up. For a child, use gentle yet firm pressure to avoid damaging the internal organs. Give five abdominal thrusts. Check if the blockage has been removed. Repeat as needed."
"What should you do if you are the only rescuer?","If you're the only rescuer, give back blows and abdominal thrusts first. Then call 911 or your local emergency number for help."
"What should you do if the person becomes unconscious?","If the person becomes unconscious, start standard cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) with chest compressions and rescue breaths."
"What should you do if the person is pregnant or if you can't get your arms around the stomach?","Give chest thrusts. Put your hands at the base of the breastbone, just above the joining of the lowest ribs. Press hard into the chest with a quick thrust. This is the same action as the Heimlich maneuver. Repeat until the blockage is removed from the airway."
"What should you do to clear the airway of an unconscious person who is choking?","Lower the person onto the floor, with the back on the floor and arms to the sides. Clear the airway. If you can see the object, reach a finger into the mouth to sweep out the object. Never finger sweep if you can't see the object. You risk pushing the blockage deeper into the airway. This is very risky with young children. Begin CPR if the person still doesn't respond. If the airway is still blocked, use chest compressions such as those that are used in CPR to remove the stuck object. Only use two rescue breaths per cycle. Recheck the mouth regularly for the object."
"What should you do to clear the airway of a choking infant younger than age 1?","Sit and hold the infant facedown on your forearm. Rest your forearm on your thigh. Hold the infant's chin and jaw to support the head. Place the head lower than the trunk. Thump the infant gently but firmly five times on the middle of the back. Use the heel of your hand. Point your fingers up so that you don't hit the back of the infant's head. Gravity and the back thumps should release the blockage. Turn the infant faceup on your forearm if breathing hasn't started. Rest your arm on your thigh. Place the infant's head lower than the trunk. Give five gentle but firm chest compressions with your fingers. Place two fingers just below the nipple line. Press down about 1 1/2 inches. Let the chest rise between each compression. Repeat the back thumps and chest compressions if breathing doesn't start. Call for emergency medical help. Begin infant CPR if the airway is clear but the infant doesn't start breathing."
"What should you do if you're alone and choking?","Call 911 or your local emergency number right away. Then, give yourself abdominal thrusts, also called the Heimlich maneuver, to remove the stuck object. Place a fist slightly above your navel. Grasp your fist with the other hand. Bend over a hard surface. A countertop or chair will do. Shove your fist inward and upward."
"What is a dislocation?","A dislocation is an injury in which the ends of your bones are forced from their normal positions."
"What is the usual cause of dislocation?","The cause is usually trauma resulting from a fall, an auto accident, or a collision during contact or high-speed sports."
"Which joints are usually involved in dislocation?","Dislocation usually involves the body's larger joints. In adults, the most common site of the injury is the shoulder. In children, it's the elbow. Your thumb and fingers also are vulnerable if forcibly bent the wrong way."
"What are the symptoms of dislocation?","The injury will temporarily deform and immobilize your joint and may result in sudden and severe pain and swelling."
"What should you do if you believe you have dislocated a joint?","Don't delay medical care. Get medical help immediately. Don't move the joint. Until you receive help, splint the affected joint into its fixed position. Don't try to move a dislocated joint or force it back into place. This can damage the joint and its surrounding muscles, ligaments, nerves or blood vessels. Put ice on the injured joint. This can help reduce swelling by controlling internal bleeding and the buildup of fluids in and around the injured joint."
"Why should you not try to move a dislocated joint back into place?","This can damage the joint and its surrounding muscles, ligaments, nerves or blood vessels."
"What should you do if you swallow a foreign object?","If you swallow a foreign object and it is stuck in your esophagus or blocks your airway and causes choking, seek immediate medical attention.

"What are the symptoms of an object stuck in the esophagus?","Symptoms include pain from the throat down the middle of the chest and regurgitating food or drink."
"What should you do if someone is choking on a foreign object?","If a choking person can cough forcefully, let the person keep coughing. Coughing might naturally remove the stuck object. If a person can't cough, talk, cry or laugh forcefully, give first aid to the person. The American Red Cross recommends giving five back blows and five abdominal thrusts, alternating between the two, until the blockage is dislodged. If the choking person becomes unconscious, clear the airway and begin CPR."
"What should you do if the choking person becomes unconscious?","If the choking person becomes unconscious, lower the person onto the floor, clear the airway, and begin CPR if the person still doesn't respond. Recheck the mouth regularly for the object."
"How do you give abdominal thrusts to someone else?","Stand behind the person and place one foot slightly in front of the other for balance.

"What is the caution about using syrup of ipecac?","Don't give syrup of ipecac or do anything to induce vomiting. Expert groups, including the American Association of Poison Control Centers and the American Academy of Pediatrics, no longer endorse using ipecac in children or adults who have taken pills or other potentially poisonous substances. No good evidence proves its effectiveness, and it often can do more harm than good. If you still have old bottles of syrup of ipecac in your home, throw them away."
"What should you do if a child has swallowed a button battery?","If you suspect that a child has swallowed one of these batteries, immediately take him or her for an emergency X-ray to determine its location. If the battery is in the esophagus, it will have to be removed. If it has passed into the stomach, it's usually safe to allow it to pass on through the intestinal tract."
"What should you do if you think a child got hold of medicated patches?","If you think a child got hold of medicated patches — adhesive products for transdermal drug delivery — carefully inspect the child's skin and remove any that are attached. Also check the roof of the mouth, where medicated patches can get stuck if the child sucks on them."
"What is anaphylaxis?","Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening allergic reaction that can cause shock, a sudden drop in blood pressure, and trouble breathing."

"What should you do if someone is having an allergic reaction with signs of anaphylaxis?","If you're with someone having an allergic reaction with signs of anaphylaxis, immediately call 911 or your local medical emergency number. Ask if the person is carrying an epinephrine autoinjector (EpiPen, Auvi-Q, others) to treat an allergic attack. If the person needs to use an autoinjector, ask whether you should help inject the medication. This is usually done by pressing the autoinjector against the person's thigh. Have the person lie face up and be still. Loosen tight clothing and cover the person with a blanket. Don't give the person anything to drink. If there's vomiting or bleeding from the mouth, turn the person to the side to prevent choking. If there are no signs of breathing, coughing or movement, begin CPR. Do uninterrupted chest presses — about 100 every minute — until paramedics arrive. Get emergency treatment even if symptoms start to improve. After anaphylaxis, it's possible for symptoms to start again (recur). Monitoring in a hospital for several hours is usually necessary."
"Are antihistamine pills enough to treat anaphylaxis?","No, antihistamine pills such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl) aren't enough to treat anaphylaxis. These medications can help relieve allergy symptoms, but they work too slowly in a severe reaction."
"What are some common triggers for anaphylaxis?","Some common anaphylaxis triggers include medications, latex, foods such as peanuts, tree nuts, fish, and shellfish, and insect stings from bees, yellow jackets, wasps, hornets, and fire ants."
"What should you do if you've had a severe allergic reaction in the past?","If you've had any kind of severe allergic reaction in the past, ask your doctor if you should be prescribed an epinephrine autoinjector to carry with you."
